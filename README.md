# Programming 1: Personal Programming Practice 10

---

Write a program to solve the following problems. You may discuss and collaborate with your peers, but you should submit your own code and fully understand all code you submit. If you work with others on one of the parts, cite your collaborators in a comment near the top of that file.

In **palindrome.py**, write a recursive funciton to determine if the input string is a palindrome. Then ask the user for a string input and check if that input is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards and backwards. Another way to phrase that is: a string is a palindrome if the first and last characters are equal and the remaining characters in the middle form a palindrome. For example, 'noon' and 'redivider' are palindromes.


In **handshake.py**, write a recursive function to solve the classic 'handshake problem.' Then ask the user for a positive integer (don't validate this input) and compute the result of the handshake problem.

Suppose there are n people in a room, where n is a positive integer. Each person shakes hands once with every other person in the room. What is the total number of handshakes in the room?


***Bonus*** Add validation *in the recursive function* in handshake.py to ensure only valid input is given *to the function*.
